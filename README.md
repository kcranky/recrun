# joggr
A meteor app for generating and storing running/cycling routes.

The app gets your location, and, based on your requested distance, generates random routes starting and ending at your current location. It is possible to then store the routes, and accept the route. 

When the route is accepted in the web app, the user is taken to maps.google.com and given the directions, as they would in a regular scenario when looking for directions.
When the route is opened in the mobile app, the user is given the option to open the directions service in whichever map client they wish.

Stored routes can be retrieved at a later stage, to be reused.
